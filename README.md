# Tone Changer â€“ Prompt Engineering Tool

## ðŸ§  Objective
This project demonstrates how changing the structure of a prompt influences the tone of an AI-generated response.

## ðŸŽ¯ Use Case
User inputs a plain sentence. The tool then generates prompts for:
- Formal tone
- Friendly tone
- Motivational tone
- Funny tone

## ðŸ’¡ Example
Input: `Your meeting has been canceled.`

Outputs:
- **Formal:** We regret to inform you that the scheduled meeting has been canceled.
- **Friendly:** Hey! Just a heads-up â€” the meetingâ€™s off today ðŸ˜Š
- **Motivational:** Even setbacks like a canceled meeting are chances to refocus and win the day!
- **Funny:** Plot twist: your meeting got canceled before you even made up an excuse ðŸ˜…

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Python (for prompt simulation)
- Prompt Engineering principles: Role prompting, instruction tuning

## ðŸ“¦ Files
- `main.py` â€“ Python script for simulating prompts
- `README.md` â€“ This documentation

## ðŸ“š Learnings
- Prompt phrasing dramatically affects output tone
- Simple tweaks in wording can guide AI style and behavior
